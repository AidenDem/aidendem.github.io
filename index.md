# Backstory
## Prelude (2030-2034)
In the early 2030s, the world found itself on the brink of catastrophe. A second Cold War erupted between the United States and Russia, fueled by territorial disputes, cyberwarfare, and a renewed arms race. Proxy wars flared across Eastern Europe, South Asia, and the Arctic, further destabilizing the global order. Nations became locked in a vicious cycle of mistrust, increasing their stockpiles of nuclear weapons in anticipation of an inevitable conflict.  
The breaking point came in 2034 during a high-stakes NATO summit. Miscommunication between NATO forces and Russian air defense systems caused the downing of a strategic bomber near Finland's border. Both sides assumed the worst, interpreting the incident as the opening salvo of a global war. Within minutes, nuclear arsenals across the globe were activated.  
A joint operation between Finland's government and United Nations personnel was underway in the Arctic at the time, focusing on mitigating tensions in the region. The operation involved two key figures from the United Nations: Aiden and Mani, both respected yet pragmatic diplomats. Their efforts were interrupted when the network of early-warning systems across Europe detected inbound intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). A frantic emergency broadcast was transmitted.  
Seconds later, alarms blared in bunkers across the globe. Aiden and Mani, acting swiftly, directed their personnel to take shelter in a heavily fortified fallout bunker beneath Northern Finland.

## The End of the World (2034)
An estimated 14,700 nuclear warheads detonated globally over the course of 24 hours, obliterating entire continents. The initial blasts killed billions, while the ensuing radiation turned survivors into horrifyingly mutated creatures. Firestorms consumed cities, and ashes rose into the stratosphere, blocking sunlight and plunging the planet into a nuclear winter.  
In the chaos that followed, temperatures plummeted, creating an environment of eternal frost. Even after the ashes dissipated, the earth remained locked in a cycle of cold and reflection, as snow and ice amplified the sunlight, preventing any warming.  
By the end of 2035, humanity had lost 95% of its population. Survivors—human, mutant, and otherwise—scavenged amidst ruins, battling starvation, radiation, and each other.

## The Last Bastion (2034-2037)
Roughly three months after the apocalypse, the bunker beneath Northern Finland became a beacon of activity. Aiden and Mani, the highest-ranking officials left in the chain of command, took control of the remnants of the United Nations, they pivoted to a militarized, authoritarian structure, declaring their intent to rebuild civilization no matter the cost, now under the name "United Nations Directorate".  
The United Nations Directorate quickly resorted to ruthless tactics. They commandeered supplies from survivors, forcibly conscripted those deemed useful, and executed anyone who opposed their rule. Despite this, their resourcefulness and resolve allowed them to establish a functional base of operations in the Arctic by 2037.  
The base is a sprawling installation of reinforced structures, vehicle depots, and a functional airstrip for pre-war helicopters. Powered by an old geothermal power plant, it represents one of the last bastions of organized humanity. The area around the base is perilous, referred to as "The Wasteland" by UND personnel. This region includes:
- Ruined Cities: Collapsed buildings buried in snow and ice, overrun by mutants.
- Mutant Zones: Areas with high concentrations of radiation and horrific creatures.
- Scavenger Towns: Small enclaves of survivors, where desperation breeds violence and mistrust.
- Raider Camps: Organized groups of bandits who attack both survivors and UN patrols.

## The Rise of the Resistance (2037)
The United Nations Directorate’s authoritarian measures alienated many survivors, giving rise to a resistance movement. Known as The Accord, this faction is an alliance of scavengers, defectors, and former UND personnel. Operating out of hidden outposts deep within the Arctic wasteland, The Accord aims to topple the UND and create a decentralized network of survivor communities.  
The Accord’s ideology is rooted in freedom and mutual aid, contrasting starkly with the UND’s iron-fisted rule. However, they are far from saintly—many of The Accord leaders are willing to commit atrocities to achieve their goals. Their conflict with the UND is one of brutal attrition, fought through ambushes, sabotage, and propaganda.

# Factions
## The Accord
### Backstory
The Accord was formed around early 2037 as a resistance movement against the oppressive United Nations Directorate. It is an alliance of defectors from the UND, scavengers, and survivors who rejected the authoritarian rule of Aiden and Mani. Operating out of hidden outposts across the Arctic wasteland, the Accord is decentralized, with no central authority or leader, and is driven by the belief that humanity's future lies in freedom and cooperation.  
Despite the Accord’s decentralized nature, they have managed to communicate and coordinate through a hidden network that they have been slowly building up. Some members of the Accord have access to this network, which is spread across a series of underground tunnels they’ve been constructing. These tunnels, which snake through the unforgiving terrain, were built to escape both the prying eyes of the UND and the brutal weather conditions.  
The tunnels serve as a lifeline, enabling the Accord to move personnel, resources, and messages across vast distances without risking exposure to the dangers of the surface. However, the network remains small due to the extreme difficulty of mining tunnels in such harsh conditions, limiting the overall effectiveness and scope of their operations.
They aim to challenge the UND's control through sabotage, ambushes, and guerilla tactics, hoping to one day dismantle the organization and give power back to the people.

### Goals
The Accord's main goal is to overthrow the United Nations Directorate and create a decentralized network of autonomous survivor communities. They believe that humanity can rebuild without the need for a totalitarian government, focusing instead on mutual aid and self-governance. While they fight for freedom, the Accord is willing to use violence and manipulation to achieve their ends, as they see it as necessary for their vision of a free society.

### Leadership
The Accord has no single leader, it instead exists out a council made up of key figures from various factions and survivor groups.

## United Nations Directorate
### Backstory
The United Nations (UN) was reformed in late 2034, three months after the global nuclear war nearly wiped out humanity. In the wake of the devastation, two key figures, Aiden and Mani, emerged as the leaders of the surviving world order. They took control of the remnants of the UN, determined to restore civilization and order at any cost, under a new banner known as the "United Nations Directorate".  
The UND operates from a heavily fortified base in the Arctic in Northern Finland, which is powered by geothermal energy. From here, they exert control over the surrounding wasteland, using force to conquer smaller survivor groups and to secure vital resources. The UND is a military dictatorship, and all big decisions are made by Aiden and Mani.
The UND enforces labor-based survival, with rationed supplies being distributed exclusively to those who work for them. Those who contribute to the reconstruction effort—whether through labor, military service, or resource gathering—are given food, medicine, and shelter. These ration systems are strictly controlled, ensuring that the UND maintains a stronghold over its population.  
To gather new resources, the UND sends out supply squads on dangerous missions to raid abandoned cities, settlements, or scavenge through the wasteland. These squads often return with much-needed supplies like medical resources, fuel, or technology, ensuring the continued survival of the UND base and its authoritarian regime.

### Goals
The main goal of the UND is to rebuild civilization by any means necessary, even if it means using force, exploitation, and harsh measures. They are obsessed with gathering pre-war technology and maintaining control over what’s left of the world's resources.

### Leadership
The leadership of the United Nations Directorate is comprised of Marshal Aiden and Field General Mani.

# Mutants
## Backstory
The detonation of over 14,000 nuclear warheads unleashed catastrophic levels of radiation across the planet, altering DNA at an unprecedented scale. The immediate and immense radiation from the bombs triggered rapid mutations in both flora and fauna. In humans, the genetic damage was so severe that their DNA began mutating at an accelerated rate, a process that had never been seen in such magnitude before. 
The survivors of this mutation process became twisted and mutated creatures, with drastic changes occurring in a matter of months instead of the slow, gradual shifts that might normally take generations. The extreme conditions of radiation and extreme cold contributed to an evolution of monstrous proportions, and these creatures adapted quickly to their new world.

## Mutant Types
### Crawlers
#### Description
Crawlers are mutants who have lost the ability to walk due to severe injuries or advanced decay. These grotesque beings drag themselves across the ground using their arms, often hiding in shadows or beneath debris to ambush unsuspecting prey. Despite their lack of mobility, Crawlers are unnervingly persistent, biting or clawing at anything within reach.
#### Abilities

- Easily destroyed by powerful weapons that target their fragile bodies.

### Juggernauts
#### Description
These hulking mutants are slow but incredibly strong, with thick, leathery skin that makes them nearly impervious to small arms fire. Juggernauts are the remnants of particularly large or muscular humans who mutated into towering, brute-like monstrosities. They can break through barricades, crush vehicles, and take on entire squads of survivors with sheer brute force.
#### Abilities
- Extreme physical strength.
- Resistant to small arms fire due to thick, leathery skin.
- Can cause massive damage to structures, vehicles, and survivors with their raw power.
#### Behaviour
- Juggernauts are slow and methodical in their movements but highly dangerous when provoked.
- They are territorial and will attack anything that poses a threat to their domain.
- Typically solitary, Juggernauts prefer to destroy anything in their path rather than engage in prolonged combat.
#### Weaknesses
- Slow-moving, making them vulnerable to traps or ranged attacks that target weak points in their bodies.
- They can be distracted or led into environments that hinder their movement.

### Rotters
#### Description
Rotters are the most common type of mutant, characterized by their severely decayed bodies and sluggish movements. They shuffle aimlessly until provoked by sound or movement, at which point they lurch toward their target. Despite their slow pace, Rotters pose a significant threat in large numbers.
#### Abilities
- Slow, shambling movements.
- Highly persistent, relentlessly pursuing targets once alerted.
- Large groups of Rotters can overwhelm even well-prepared survivors.
#### Behaviour
- Rotters are solitary or found in small groups, and they lack the intelligence to strategize or coordinate.
- They are driven primarily by a basic urge to feed, seeking out any form of life.
- While they pose a smaller threat individually, their numbers make them a dangerous presence in the wasteland.
#### Weaknesses
- Slow-moving and easy to outrun or avoid if isolated.
- Vulnerable to blunt force attacks and firearms, especially if targeted in the head.

### Scramblers
#### Description
Scramblers are horrifyingly agile and less decayed mutants that have retained most of their muscular structure. Their unnerving speed and ability to climb or leap over obstacles make them some of the most dangerous mutants in close combat. Scramblers often hunt in packs, working together to corner and overwhelm their prey. Their erratic movements and feral growls create an atmosphere of chaos during encounters.
#### Abilities
- Exceptional agility and speed.
- Can leap over obstacles or climb structures with ease.
- Unpredictable movements, making them difficult to target.
#### Behaviour
- Scramblers are highly aggressive, often hunting in packs to corner and overwhelm prey.

- Scramblers are often found in urban ruins or near settlements, where they can easily ambush survivors.
#### Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to ranged attacks if caught in the open.
- Can be tricked or led into traps if their erratic behavior is exploited.

### Screamers
#### Description
Screamers are twisted abominations with grotesquely mutated vocal cords, capable of emitting piercing, inhuman wails that reverberate through the frozen wasteland. Their screams serve as a call to other mutants, triggering frenzied swarms that overwhelm even the most prepared survivors.
#### Abilities
- Emit high-pitched, inhuman screams.
- Can summon swarms of other mutants to converge on a target.
- Ability to disorient and deafen those in proximity to their shrieks.
#### Behaviour
- Screamers are fragile on their own, but they rely on their ability to call in other mutants to swarm and overwhelm their prey.
- They are highly territorial, and once they detect movement or sound, they will shriek loudly, attracting nearby threats.
- Their screams can shatter the silence of the wasteland, marking their presence for miles.
#### Weaknesses
- Physically weak when isolated and easily dispatched if caught alone.
- Vulnerable to stealth or ambush attacks if they cannot summon help.

# Survivor Types
## Loners
### Description
Loners are fiercely independent survivalists who rely on their wits, skills, and distrust of others to survive. They often avoid all factions and groups, preferring the solitude of the wasteland to the risks of betrayal or exploitation.
### Objectives
- **Total independence**: Loners are committed to surviving on their own, avoiding any form of dependency on other survivors or factions.
- **Self-sufficiency**: They rely on their resourcefulness and survival skills to gather food, water, and shelter.
- **Avoidance of conflict**: Loners try to steer clear of other groups and factions, preferring to stay out of any major power struggles.
### General Behaviour
- Loners are introverted and private, trusting only themselves or a very small circle of acquaintances.
- They are highly self-reliant, carrying minimal gear but making the most of their tools and supplies.
- Though not usually confrontational, they will fight if they have to, especially to protect themselves or their scarce resources.
### Common Activities
- **Hunting and gathering**: Loners are skilled hunters, using their knowledge of the land to trap or ambush wild animals and mutants for food.
- **Scavenging alone**: They prefer to go on their own scavenging missions, avoiding larger groups that could pose a threat to their autonomy.

## Nomads
### Description
Nomads are the eternal wanderers, moving from ruin to ruin in search of sustenance and shelter. They survive through adaptability and an intimate knowledge of hidden paths and scavenging spots. Nomads avoid prolonged conflict, relying on speed and mobility to evade threats.
### Objectives
- **Survival through mobility**: Nomads prioritize remaining mobile, constantly moving to find resources and shelter.
- **Scavenging**: They focus on scavenging from ruins and other dangerous areas to gather food, medicine, and supplies.
- **Avoid conflict**: They try to avoid confrontation with other factions and mutants, relying on their knowledge of the land to stay safe.
### General Behaviour
- Nomads are highly independent and rarely form large groups, preferring to travel in small, tight-knit units or even alone.
- They are opportunistic, always looking for a quick, safe way to get what they need.
- While not aggressive, they are skilled at defending themselves if cornered or threatened.
### Common Activities
- **Tracking safe paths**: Nomads are excellent at finding safe routes through the wasteland, avoiding radiation hotspots and mutant-infested zones.
- **Trading**: Some Nomads act as intermediaries, trading scavenged goods with other survivors or factions.

## Raiders
### Description
Raiders are brutal opportunists who thrive on violence and fear. They form tightly-knit bands that plunder settlements, caravans, and scavengers alike. For raiders, survival is the absolute priority, and they stop at nothing to take what others have.
### Objectives
- **Plunder and pillage**: Raiders are primarily focused on taking anything they can—food, weapons, and other valuable resources—through force.
- **Expand their territory**: They seek to dominate weaker survivors or settlements and control their resources.
- **Recruitment**: Raiders often forcefully recruit survivors or capture them for use in their camps or as slaves.
### General Behaviour
- Raiders are aggressive, merciless, and use fear and violence to keep others in submission.
- They travel in groups, often setting ambushes or launching surprise attacks on vulnerable settlements or lone survivors.
- They are territorial and will defend their stolen territory fiercely, often setting up brutal, highly guarded outposts.
### Common Activities
- **Raiding settlements**: Raiders frequently attack other survivor groups or outposts to loot their resources and supplies.
- **Enslaving or exploiting survivors**: They may capture survivors to use as labor or for other nefarious purposes.

## Scavengers
### Description
Scavengers are the lifeblood of the wasteland economy, risking their lives to explore radiation-soaked ruins and mutant-infested cities for valuable resources. They are resourceful and cunning, but their solitary nature often leaves them vulnerable to larger threats.
### Objectives
- **Gather resources**: Scavengers are primarily focused on finding and collecting valuable materials such as fuel, medical supplies, and technology.
- **Sell or trade findings**: They often trade their scavenged goods with other survivors or factions, helping to fuel the local economy.
- **Survive in harsh conditions**: Scavengers focus on getting in and out of dangerous areas with what they can carry.
### General Behaviour
- Scavengers are often solitary, but they can sometimes form loose networks to share information and trade.
- They are cautious and prefer stealth over direct conflict, as they often carry limited protection.
- They are highly resourceful, able to make use of nearly anything they find to survive.
### Common Activities
- **Exploring ruins**: Scavengers often go on dangerous expeditions into abandoned cities or military sites to find valuable technology, tools, and resources.
- **Repairing and repurposing**: Scavengers are skilled at fixing or reusing old technology to create new solutions for survival.

# The World
## Climate
The world of 2037 is an unrelenting expanse of cold and despair, shaped by the aftermath of nuclear winter. The detonation of over 14,000 nuclear warheads injected vast quantities of ash, soot, and radioactive particles into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and plunging the planet into an extended freeze. Temperatures have dropped to unprecedented levels, averaging between -30°C and -50°C in most regions. Even once-temperate zones are now blanketed by permanent ice and snow. The sun, when visible, is a pale, distant memory, struggling to pierce the toxic haze that chokes the sky.
## Weather
### Blizzards
Blizzards are frequent and merciless, consuming the landscape in walls of ice and wind. Ruins vanish beneath meters of snow, entombing whatever remnants of civilization remain. Winds howl at speeds exceeding 100 km/h, stripping exposed flesh within seconds and tearing apart fragile structures weakened by years of neglect. Snowdrifts shift like dunes, reshaping the terrain overnight and making navigation a deadly gamble. These storms can last for days, their fury unrelenting, and those caught in the open find themselves buried alive, frozen in place before they can dig themselves free. The only warning is the sudden silence before the first gust—a moment of eerie stillness before the world turns white.
### Radiation Storms
Carried by erratic winds, radioactive particles from the war still drift through the atmosphere, descending in lethal waves. These radiation storms strike without warning, their effects unseen until it is too late. While most fallout is invisible, certain storms are thick with glowing green dust, casting a sickly hue over the wasteland. The air itself seems to shimmer, and an acrid metallic taste clings to the tongue. Exposure is deadly—prolonged contact with the irradiated air causes burns, sickness, and in many cases, a slow and agonizing death. Makeshift Geiger counters are a survivor’s only defense, their frantic clicks the difference between life and an invisible execution. Even after the storm passes, the ground remains contaminated, turning once-safe areas into toxic wastelands.
### Low Fog
A thick, creeping fog sometimes rolls over the wasteland, settling in ruins and low valleys like a ghost that refuses to leave. It muffles sound, making even your own footsteps feel distant, and turns the world into a blur of shifting shadows. On the worst days, visibility drops to just a few meters, making travel dangerous—not because the fog itself will kill you, but because you won’t see what’s waiting ahead until it’s too late.
Something about the way the fog distorts sound makes people uneasy. A voice that seems nearby could be coming from hundreds of meters away, and echoes bounce in unnatural ways. Some survivors tell stories of hearing footsteps that weren’t theirs or whispers carried on the wind, but that’s probably just the mind playing tricks. Probably.
The fog usually clears after a few hours, but when it lingers, people tend to stay put. Not because it’s deadly, but because in a world this dangerous, being blind to what’s around you is just as bad.
### Brief Clarity
On rare occasions, the sky clears just enough for weak sunlight to filter through the ashen clouds. These brief moments of clarity are misleading, a fragile reprieve in a world that no longer forgives. The temperature remains frigid, but the wind stills, and for a short time, the land is eerily quiet. The sun appears as a dim, reddish disc, its warmth long since stolen by the soot-choked stratosphere. Despite the dangers, survivors venture out during these moments to scavenge and travel, knowing it may be weeks before the next opportunity arises. However, the silence is unsettling—without the howling wind, every distant sound carries, and one is never sure whether they are truly alone.
### Dry Thunderstorms
These storms roll in fast, with thick, black clouds stretching across the sky like a warning. But unlike normal storms, they bring no rain—just flashes of lightning and the deep, distant rumble of thunder. The air feels charged, like the whole wasteland is holding its breath. Then, without warning, bolts of lightning slam into the ground, striking ruins, vehicles, or anything standing too tall. Fires sometimes spark up, but in this frozen world, they don’t last long.
The real danger isn’t just the lightning—it’s the chaos that comes with it. The sudden flashes mess with your eyes, making it hard to see what’s lurking in the dark. Some survivors swear that these storms mess with electronics too, frying radios and Geiger counters, leaving you blind to the dangers around you. Others claim the lightning isn’t natural, that something about the war changed it. Whatever the truth is, when the sky starts flashing and the thunder rolls in, smart survivors find shelter fast.

## Economy
By 2037, the old world’s economic systems are nothing but a memory, replaced by a raw and unforgiving barter-based economy where survival trumps wealth. With no centralized government, no functioning banks, and no reliable means of mass production, survivors have been forced to adapt, trading whatever they can to secure food, shelter, and protection.
### Trade & Barter
Most exchanges are direct—one item for another, skill for skill. A can of food might be worth a handful of bullets, a medical kit might fetch a warm coat, and a skilled mechanic could trade their expertise for a week’s worth of rations. The value of items fluctuates based on scarcity, necessity, and location. In settlements where food is scarce, a simple meal can be worth more than gold ever was. In the frozen wasteland, warmth is currency—fuel, lighters, insulated clothing, even a decent pair of boots can mean the difference between life and death.
### Localized Currencies
Some outposts have developed their own form of currency, though it’s always something with practical value. Bullets are one of the most common—small, portable, and always in demand. Medical supplies, fuel, and even clean water serve as alternative currencies in certain areas. However, without a stable system to back them, these currencies can collapse overnight if the settlement falls or if the item they’re based on becomes too common or too rare.
Some groups attempt to maintain order by issuing crude ration cards or stamped metal tokens to standardize trade, but trust in these systems is fragile. More often than not, barter remains the dominant means of exchange, as survivors prefer tangible goods they can hold in their hands.
### Professions & Services
While scavenging is the most common means of acquiring goods, some survivors carve out a living through specialized skills. Medics, mechanics, gunsmiths, and hunters are among the most valued members of any community. Blacksmiths and craftsmen capable of repairing or repurposing old-world tech are highly sought after, while traders and guides risk their lives moving between settlements, ferrying news and supplies.
Not all work is honest, though. Mercenaries and bounty hunters offer their services to the highest bidder, whether it’s for protection, assassinations, or tracking down those who have crossed the wrong people. Smugglers move stolen goods through the frozen wastes, often dealing in high-risk, high-reward trades—rare ammunition, experimental meds, or even functioning electronics. Slavers, though despised, still operate in the darker corners of the world, selling captives as laborers to desperate outposts.
### Scavenging in Frozen Ruins
In this world, the most valuable resources are found in the most dangerous places. Scavengers risk their lives picking through the ruins of dead cities, avoiding mutants, radiation pockets, and collapsing buildings just to bring back a handful of supplies. Hunters stalk the few remaining animals, competing with both the cold and other desperate survivors for fresh meat. Salvagers dive into frozen lakes and rivers, searching for lost caches buried beneath the ice.
More organized groups run large-scale salvage operations, but these come with their own dangers. Bandits often wait for scavengers to do the hard work before swooping in to take everything by force. Some settlements even run scavenger lotteries—volunteers are sent into the ruins, and whatever they find is divided up by the community. It’s a desperate system, but desperation is all most people have left.
### Reputation & Trust
In a world without laws, trust is its own form of currency. A survivor’s word, once broken, is hard to mend. Traders who shortchange their customers, mercenaries who abandon their contracts, or thieves who steal from their own people often find themselves exiled, or worse. Some outposts keep blacklists of known liars and thieves, making it impossible for them to trade anywhere.
On the flip side, those with a reputation for fairness and reliability are often welcomed wherever they go. A well-known doctor might never go hungry, simply because people recognize their worth. A skilled tracker who never fails to find their target will always have work. In this world, survival isn’t just about what you have—it’s about who you are, and whether others believe you’re worth keeping around.

## Food & Supplies
In 2037, food is more than just sustenance—it is power. The frozen wasteland offers little in the way of nourishment, forcing survivors to scavenge, hunt, or steal to stay alive. Hunger is a constant, gnawing presence, and the weak often perish before they can find their next meal. Those who control food control life itself, making it the most sought-after commodity in the wasteland.
### Farming & Settlements
Few settlements are fortunate enough to grow their own food. In rare cases, underground greenhouses or hydroponic farms provide a steady food source, but maintaining them requires energy, equipment, and knowledge that most survivors lack.
For those without such luxuries, more primitive methods are used—mushroom farms in damp tunnels, insect breeding for protein, or cultivating algae in makeshift vats. Every edible plant is a treasure, and those who control food production hold immense power.
### The Struggle to Eat
With agriculture nearly impossible, survivors rely on whatever food they can find. Some of the most common sources of nourishment include:
- **Mutant Meat**: Consuming the flesh of mutated animals is a gamble. Some claim it keeps them alive; others succumb to sickness, radiation poisoning, or worse. Even when cooked, the meat is often tainted.
- **Rodents & Insects**: Rats, mice, and bugs have survived where larger animals have perished. Though unappetizing, they are a vital source of protein.
- **Cannibalism**: A dark but growing reality. Some eat the dead out of desperation. Others hunt the living.
- **Scavenged Rations**: Pre-war food is a rare and valuable find. Even decades-old, half-rotten supplies are considered worth the risk.
### Hunting in the Frozen Wasteland
Hunting in the frozen wasteland is nearly impossible. Most wildlife has been wiped out, and the few creatures that remain are either horribly mutated or on the verge of extinction. Fresh meat is an extreme rarity, and those who manage to secure it are considered either incredibly lucky or dangerously skilled.
- **The Rarity of Wildlife**: Natural animals are all but extinct. Occasionally, a desperate survivor may stumble upon a starving, frostbitten deer or a pack of half-dead wolves, but such encounters are few and far between.
- **Trade Value of Meat**: A slab of fresh, untainted meat is worth more than gold. Those who manage to bring in a fresh kill can barter it for nearly anything they need—assuming they can hold onto it long enough to trade.
### UND Rations & Control
The United Nations Directorate (UND) controls food supplies in its territories with strict rationing systems. Every calorie is accounted for, and survival under their rule depends entirely on one’s usefulness.
- **Work for Food**: Food is not freely given, it is earned. UND members are assigned labor based on their skills and physical ability, from maintaining infrastructure to producing power. The harder the job, the bigger the ration. Those who fail to meet their quotas receive less—and starvation is a slow execution.
- **Harsh Enforcement**: Stealing food from UND stores is considered treason. Guards patrol supply depots, and those caught hoarding or skimming rations face swift punishment—often exile, a slow death in the frozen wasteland.
### Desperation & Violence
In a world where hunger is constant, violence over food is inevitable.
- **Raiding**: Raiders target settlements and travelers, taking food by force. Few outposts are safe from their attacks.
- **Betrayal**: A hungry man is a desperate man. Survivors will kill over a single meal. Trust is rare, and friendships are often tested by starvation.

## Landscape
The post-apocalyptic world of 2037 is a desolate and frozen expanse, transformed by nuclear war and its devastating aftermath. Familiar landmarks have been buried under layers of ice and snow, and the terrain is as hostile as it is unrecognizable. What was once a vibrant and thriving world is now a bleak, unending wasteland where survival is a daily struggle against the elements and the horrors that lurk within them.
### Ruined Cities
Once-thriving metropolises are now lifeless ruins, their skeletal remains jutting out of the snow like forgotten monuments to a lost age. Skyscrapers lean precariously, their glass and steel facades shattered by the initial blasts and the relentless passage of time. Streets are buried under meters of ice, and vehicles frozen in place serve as grim reminders of the chaos that marked humanity's final hours. The few habitable sections of these cities are scavenged relentlessly, their interiors turned into makeshift shelters or battlegrounds between desperate survivors and mutated creatures.
### The Wasteland
Between ruined settlements and icy plains lies "The Wasteland," an unforgiving expanse of snow-covered tundra, shattered highways, and buried debris. This no-man's-land is riddled with dangers: predators, mutants, and environmental traps like thin ice, crevices, and avalanches. Traversing this terrain is a gamble with death. Frozen rivers and lakes offer potential shortcuts, but the ice is often unstable, and those who misjudge their footing may vanish into the dark, frigid waters below.
Storms sweep across The Wasteland without warning, bringing blizzards that can blind and disorient even the most experienced travelers. The relentless cold is a weapon in itself—frostbite claims the unprepared, and exposure to the elements can be as fatal as any hostile encounter. Remnants of highways and bridges emerge like eerie relics from beneath the ice, their cracked surfaces telling stories of destruction and abandonment.
### Radiation Zones
Certain regions of the wasteland are so heavily irradiated that they have become home to nightmarish mutations. These zones are filled with grotesque creatures, twisted by radiation into horrifying forms. Some are barely recognizable as former humans, while others are entirely new abominations, adapted to the frozen, toxic environment. The air in these places is thick with radioactive haze, and prolonged exposure guarantees sickness—or worse.
### Scavenger Towns
Scattered throughout the icy wasteland are small enclaves of survivors—ramshackle settlements where desperation breeds violence and mistrust. These scavenger towns are built from the remnants of the old world, with makeshift barricades of rusted metal and salvaged concrete. Resources are scarce, and disputes over food and fuel often turn deadly.
Despite the dangers, these settlements serve as the last vestiges of civilization outside of the United Nations Directorate’s control. Traders and mercenaries pass through, exchanging goods and information, while warlords and raiders seek to impose their own brutal rule over the inhabitants.
### Raider Camps
Beyond the struggling settlements, in the deep tundra and the shadows of ruined cities, lie the strongholds of the raiders. These camps are lawless enclaves where only the strongest survive. Comprised of ex-military deserters, cutthroats, and those who have given up on morality, the raiders prey upon weaker groups, striking scavenger towns and UND convoys alike. Some of the larger factions have fortified their camps with salvaged weapons, guard towers, and crude defenses, making them nearly impossible to root out.
The raiders are not a unified force; their alliances are fragile, built on convenience and power. Betrayal is common, and leaders rise and fall with brutal efficiency. They take what they want and leave nothing but destruction in their wake.
